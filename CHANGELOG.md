# Changelog

All notable changes to **ITACM — IT Asset Control Pro** are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-09-01

Two features aimed at the gaps most often raised against GLPI, and the
permission gates that attacking them turned out to need.

### Added
- **Service-desk automation rules.** "When a ticket is opened, if <conditions>
  then <actions>", configured from Service Desk → Automation rules. Conditions
  read the subject, description, category, type, source (staff / portal /
  email), requester name, email, department and request template; actions set
  the category, impact, urgency, priority, assignee or an internal note. Rules
  run in order at creation time only and write through plain SQL rather than
  `updateTicket`, so a rule can never trigger another evaluation pass. A later
  rule overrides an earlier one per field and `stopOnMatch` lets a specific rule
  shield a catch-all. Changing the priority re-targets the SLA clocks from
  creation. Text comparison folds Turkish and accented characters, so a rule
  written "yazıcı" also matches a subject typed "YAZICI". The editor carries a
  dry-run tester that evaluates unsaved drafts, and every rule keeps a match
  counter so one that never fires is visible without reading the audit log.
- **Active Directory / LDAP.** Sign-in and directory sync, each switchable on
  its own and both off by default, under Integrations → Directory. Sign-in is
  invite-only like SSO: the directory verifies the password of an account that
  already exists here and never creates one at the login screen. Sync creates
  and updates employees, resolves `manager` into the manager link the approval
  chain routes on, optionally provisions IT accounts from a group→role mapping,
  and optionally deactivates leavers. People are keyed on the directory's
  immutable object id (`objectGUID` on AD, `entryUUID` on OpenLDAP) rather than
  the DN, so a rename or an OU move updates the row instead of duplicating the
  person. Group membership is read from `memberOf` where the directory supplies
  it and from the group objects otherwise — what OpenLDAP without the memberof
  overlay needs. Run it manually, preview it first (a dry run that writes
  nothing), or schedule it hourly / daily. Attribute names are configurable;
  the defaults are Active Directory's.

### Security
Found while attacking the new endpoints with a least-privilege account holding
only `integration:manage`:

- **Directory sync could provision Admin accounts without the user-management
  right.** A holder of `integration:manage` — the group you would hand someone
  to look after SMTP and webhooks, and which is refused by
  `POST /api/auth/users` — could point the integration at a directory of their
  own, map one of its groups to `Admin`, and sign in as the account the sync
  created. `createUsers` now requires `user_management:create|manage`, checked
  on the value being saved rather than the transition, so an enabled switch
  cannot be kept while the directory underneath it is re-pointed.
- **Directory sign-in could be enabled without the user-management right.**
  Whoever turns it on while choosing the server can stand up a directory that
  answers yes to any bind for an existing address. `loginEnabled` now requires
  the same right.
- **Employee sync wrote employee rows without an employee right.**
  `syncEmployees` and `deactivateMissing` now require `employee:update|manage`,
  enforced both when saving the configuration and when triggering a run.
- **Credentials embedded in the directory URL** (`ldap://user:pass@host`) were
  stored and echoed back in cleartext; they are now rejected, since the bind
  password has an encrypted field precisely so it never sits there.
- **A rule that assigns tickets** now requires `ticket:assign`, the action
  `updateTicket` already re-checks on every manual assignee change.
- **Reading the rule set** moved from `ticket:read` to `ticket:configure` — it
  carries internal triage notes and shows who work is routed to.

Deactivation carries its own guard: if more than 30% of synced employees are
missing from one run it is skipped and reported, because that is a filter
mistake rather than a third of the company resigning.

### Fixed
- **The SLA claim in both READMEs did not match the code.** The timers run on a
  24/7 clock and pause while a ticket is *pending*; there is no business-hours
  calendar. The documentation now says so.

### Changed
- CI runs the unit suite with `--test-concurrency=1`. Running one child process
  per test file in parallel intermittently produced "Unable to deserialize
  cloned data" on Node 24 with no code change involved — the same commit passed
  on a re-run. The suite takes about a second, so serialising it costs nothing.

## [1.8.3] — 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- **A decimal asset cost was rejected with a 500 error.** Registering hardware with
  a non-integer purchase cost (e.g. `42999.50`) crashed the insert with
  `invalid input syntax for type integer`. The cause was `COALESCE($30, 0)` in the
  asset INSERT: the untyped integer literal `0` made PostgreSQL infer the bound
  cost parameter as an integer, so any value with decimals failed. The parameter
  is now cast to `numeric`, so fractional costs (money always has them) are stored
  correctly. Found during a full end-to-end pass over every module.

## [1.8.2] — 2026-08-31

Full-codebase security review (whole app, not just the Service Desk). One
confidentiality gap fixed; the rest of the review came back clean.

### Security
- **Asset costs were not gated by `view_confidential`.** The financial-access
  control (already applied to contracts, licences, mobile lines and maintenance)
  was never wired into the asset routes, so any read-capable user without the
  confidential-cost permission — including the read-only **Viewer** role — could
  read every asset's purchase `cost`, `salvageValue` and derived `bookValue` on
  the list and detail endpoints, and could set a cost on create/update. The asset
  routes now redact those fields on read and reject a cost write from a caller
  without the permission, matching the other resources. `bookValue` and
  `salvageValue` were added to the redaction set so a derived figure can't leak
  the cost back out.

### Reviewed and clean (no change needed)
- Query layer is uniformly parameterized; the AI advanced-query feature is
  contained by a dedicated read-only DB role (`itacm_ai_ro`, `ai.*` views only,
  read-only transaction) on top of its keyword/validator denylist.
- JWT algorithm is pinned (`HS256`); webhook delivery uses a pinned
  resolve-then-connect SSRF guard; the update check targets a fixed host.
- Role confinement (Portal → `/api/me/*`, HR lane, Viewer read-only) verified
  against a live instance; uploads go through the magic-byte guard; the migration
  restore rejects path-traversal and symlink escapes; record updates are
  whitelist-based (no mass assignment).

## [1.8.1] — 2026-08-30

Hardening + correctness release for the Service Desk module (security review and a
full test pass over the approval workflow).

### Security
- **Email-to-ticket sender spoofing fixed.** The DMARC check trusted any
  `Authentication-Results` header, including one a sender embedded in the message —
  so a forged `dmarc=pass` alongside the provider's real `dmarc=fail` let anyone
  open a ticket "as the CEO" and inject staff-only notes into arbitrary ticket
  numbers. The verdict is now believed only from an Owner-pinned **trusted
  authserv-id**, a real `dmarc=fail` vetoes, and the pass is bound to the exact
  From domain. Ships **fail-closed**: with no authserv-id configured, no inbound
  mail is attributed to a real requester. Configure it in **Integrations → Email
  (IMAP)**.
- **Stored IMAP password no longer exfiltratable.** `Test connection` merged the
  request body over the saved config and re-injected the decrypted password, so a
  user with `integration:manage` could make the server log in to a host of their
  choosing with a credential they cannot read. The test now refuses to reuse the
  stored password for a different host/account, and the **SSRF host guard** that
  SMTP already used is applied to IMAP save / test / poll (blocks localhost,
  private/reserved IPs and internal names). The connection error returned to the
  client is generic, so the endpoint is no longer a network oracle.
- A failed IMAP connection no longer crashes the process (the async `error` event
  is handled).

### Fixed
- **Approval chain could skip a mandatory approver.** When a step in the middle of
  a chain could not be resolved (e.g. `department` with no department manager on
  file), the request finalized as *approved* and silently skipped every later
  step — including a fixed finance approver. Unresolvable steps are now **skipped
  over**, not treated as the end of the chain; the same fix applies when the first
  step is the unresolvable one.
- **Service-request approvals could be under-routed by the requester.** A template's
  fixed (e.g. finance) approver was dropped whenever the requester's self-declared
  `amount` was missing or zero. A missing/zero amount now **fails closed** — the
  fixed approver stays; it is dropped only for a real amount provably below the
  threshold.
- **Self-approval guard tightened.** No org shape can now resolve an approver to
  the requester themselves, including a `manager2` skip-level that loops back
  through a reporting cycle.
- Portal requesters can now **withdraw their own pending request**
  (`POST /api/me/approvals/:id/cancel`); previously the withdraw path was reachable
  only by staff.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Service Desk — an ITIL-aligned ITSM module** next to the inventory. Ships
  **off by default**; enable it from Settings (nothing appears in the nav until
  you do).
  - **Incidents & service requests** with **Impact × Urgency** priority, SLA
    response/resolution timers (pause while pending, breach markers,
    auto-escalation), a Jira-style **workflow editor** (custom status
    transitions + *auto-close resolved*), canned replies, saved list views, a
    Kanban board, bulk actions, CSV export and **CSAT** on closure.
  - **Request templates + multi-step approval chains** (manager → manager's
    manager → department, sequential or parallel *any*/*all*), with delegation,
    reminders and escalation. Approvals reuse the existing generic approval
    engine and resolve approvers from the org chart.
  - **Employee self-service Portal** — the same login employees use for their
    assets — to open requests, follow their tickets, reply, attach files and
    approve what is routed to them.
  - **Three-level visibility** on comments & attachments (*public*,
    *approver-only*, *IT-only*), enforced in the SQL `WHERE` clause of every
    read path.
  - **Problem management** (root cause / workaround, linked incidents) and
    **Change enablement** (type, risk, CAB approval, schedule, rollback plan).
  - **Knowledge Base** with staff authoring, inline PDF/image attachments and a
    published-only Help Center in the portal (deflection).
  - **Email-to-ticket over IMAP** — polls a mailbox, opens tickets and
    cross-links `[REQ-1234]` replies. Sender identity is attributed only on a
    provider-verified **DMARC pass**, so a forged `From` cannot open a ticket as
    someone else.
  - **"Similar past tickets"** panel showing how comparable tickets were
    resolved.
- **Per-employee manager** (`reports to`) in the employee form, and an HTML **org
  tree** rebuilt around it — fold/unfold, avatars, and set-manager straight from
  the chart. Approval chains resolve through it.

### Changed
- Express upgraded from 4.x to **5.2**; base image moved to `node:26-alpine`.
- `README.md` documents the Service Desk; `README.tr.md` caught up with the
  Service Desk module and the SSO support added in 1.7.0.

### Security
- Staff-only ticket documents are no longer downloadable by approvers.
- Inbound email sender identity is DMARC-gated (see above).

## [1.7.0] — 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Single sign-on via OpenID Connect** (invite-only, off by default). Staff sign
  in with your identity provider (Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra, Okta, Auth0,
  Keycloak…). Authorization Code flow with **PKCE**; all token exchange is
  server-side and the ID token is validated against the provider's JWKS
  (`openid-client`). The session reaches the browser via a **single-use** handoff
  ticket.
  - **Invite-only & secure**: signs in a user who already exists in ITACM, matched
    by their **verified** email (`email_verified` required), then by the stable
    `(issuer, subject)` pair. Unknown/unverified emails and disallowed domains are
    refused; it never creates accounts or elevates roles. Local password login
    stays as a break-glass path.
  - **Configure from the UI** (Integrations → SSO): issuer, client ID, encrypted
    client secret (never shown again), the exact redirect URI to register, a
    **Test connection** check, allowed email domains, and a custom button label.
    Env vars (`SSO_*`) work as a fallback.
  - Optional **Require SSO for staff** (`SSO_REQUIRE`) — only an Owner may still
    use a password. Admins can see SSO-linked accounts in IT Users and **unlink**
    one. SSO sign-ins are recorded in the audit log.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Automatic nightly database backups** (opt-in, `BACKUP_ENABLED=1`). Once a
  day at `BACKUP_HOUR` the scheduler streams `pg_dump --clean | gzip` into
  `DATA_DIR/backups` and **verifies** each archive by fully decompressing it and
  confirming the dump header — a truncated or corrupt backup is caught
  immediately, not discovered at restore time. Keeps the newest `BACKUP_KEEP`
  copies and records every outcome in the audit log. Tune with `BACKUP_HOUR`,
  `BACKUP_KEEP`, `BACKUP_DIR`; store copies off-box too.

## [1.5.3] — 2026-08-17

### Security
- **Outbound SSRF filter hardening.** The private/reserved-IP guard that vets
  Owner-configured SMTP hosts (and other outbound targets) only unwrapped the
  dotted-decimal `::ffff:` spelling, so IPv4-mapped IPv6 in hex
  (`::ffff:7f00:1` = 127.0.0.1, `::ffff:a9fe:a9fe` = 169.254.169.254), a
  fully-expanded loopback (`0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1`), NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`) and
  deprecated IPv4-compatible (`::a.b.c.d`) literals slipped through. The filter
  now canonicalizes every IPv6 form to its embedded IPv4 / loopback before
  applying the rules, and strips any zone-id suffix.
- **AI advanced-query catalog lockdown.** The read-only role is confined to the
  curated `ai.*` views, but `pg_catalog` is always implicitly on the
  `search_path`, so unqualified system-catalog reads (`pg_roles`, `pg_settings`,
  `pg_database`, …) and server-metadata functions (`version()`,
  `current_database()`, …) still leaked server version, config and role names.
  The query validator now rejects any `pg_*` / `information_schema` reference and
  those metadata functions. No business data was ever exposed (the role holds no
  table privileges); this closes the remaining metadata disclosure.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-08-16

### Changed
- The account-lockout audit event now shows a friendly, translated label
  (short title + explanation, all 12 languages) instead of an English
  segment-derived fallback. It reads cleanly in the audit log under the
  Authentication source.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- The v1.5.0 rate-limit settings are now passed through `docker-compose.yml`
  (they are listed explicitly, so they previously never reached the container).
  Setting `RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_CIDRS` — or any other threshold — in `.env` now
  takes effect. Documented the office / shared-IP (NAT) setup and every new
  variable in the README.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Identity-based abuse protection.** Rate limits were keyed only on IP, so a
  whole office behind one NAT IP was throttled — and could lock each other
  out — as a single visitor. They now key on *who*, not only *where*:
  - **Per-account login lockout**, persisted on the user (migration 052), so
    one person's mistyped password never locks colleagues out and the lock
    survives a restart. Crossing into a locked state is written to the audit log.
  - **Per-user fair-use limit** for interactive (JWT) sessions — each user gets
    their own request budget instead of sharing an IP bucket. API keys are exempt.
  - **Trusted-network exemption** (`RATE_LIMIT_TRUSTED_CIDRS`) for the coarse
    per-IP guard and the per-IP login backstop — e.g. the office egress behind
    NAT. Authentication and the per-account lockout are never exempted.
- All thresholds and windows are environment-tunable (`API_RATE_LIMIT`,
  `USER_RATE_LIMIT`, `LOGIN_FAIL_LIMIT`, `LOGIN_LOCK_MIN`, …) — see `.env.example`.

## [1.4.4] — 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Filing an HR request no longer hangs on email.** Creating an
  onboarding/offboarding request waited for the best-effort IT-notification
  email, so a slow or unreachable SMTP server stalled the requester's submit
  until the timeout. The notification now runs in the background; the submit
  returns immediately and the outcome is still recorded (notified_at /
  notify_error).
- **The cancel reason is now visible.** When IT rejects a request, the reason
  was saved but never shown. The HR request list now displays it (full text
  on hover) on cancelled rows.

## [1.4.3] — 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Slow actions no longer look frozen.** Confirmation dialogs (grant portal
  access, deletes, revokes) and the onboarding/offboarding request submit
  buttons now show a spinner while the request is in flight, instead of
  sitting idle.
- **Granting portal access hung ~15s** when SMTP was unreachable. The SMTP
  connect/greeting timeouts are shortened to 8s (socket 12s), so a
  misconfigured mail server fails fast and the temporary password is
  revealed without the long wait.

### Changed
- Rejecting an onboarding/offboarding request now opens an in-app reason
  dialog instead of the browser's native `prompt()`.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-08-16

### Added
- A subtle light that travels around the login card's frame — a masked
  conic-gradient beam with a soft glow, purely decorative and frozen under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-08-16

### Changed
- **Redesigned the login and two-step verification screens.** A clean,
  corporate look on a light technical ground: framed inputs with leading
  icons, a distinct card, and a footer that shows the running app version.
  The change is presentational plus input handling — every form id, field
  name, error box and submit handler is unchanged, so authentication and
  server-side MFA verification behave exactly as before.

### Added
- A **password reveal** toggle on the login field.
- **Segmented six-digit MFA entry** — one box per digit with auto-advance,
  backspace, and arrow-key navigation. Pasting (or an authenticator that
  autofills every digit into one box) distributes across all six. A
  hidden **backup-code** toggle covers the "can't reach my phone" case, and
  the boxes shake on a rejected code.
- The running version is shown on the login footer.
- New `login.*` interface strings translated across all twelve UI languages.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Bulk historical zimmet PDF import** (Employees → Zimmet Import). Drop in the
  old handover forms — one PDF or many, several forms per file — and the server
  splits them into individual documents, reads the assignee's name, matches it
  to an employee and files each form on that profile. Nothing is written until
  you review the matches and confirm: split forms sit in staging, a discarded or
  abandoned batch is cleaned up (automatically after 24 hours), and every form
  shows its confidence — auto-matched, uncertain, or no match. Gated on
  `handover_document:upload` + `employee:view_handover`, and confined to the
  user's own `employee:read` department scope, so the bulk path can never file a
  document the per-employee upload would refuse.
- **OCR for scanned forms.** A scanned PDF is a picture, not text, so there is no
  name to read. With OCR on, the server reads the scan itself and the rest of the
  pipeline is unchanged — a multi-form *scan* still splits correctly. Off by
  default; toggle it in **Settings → Integrations** (`ZIMMET_OCR` is only the
  starting default, and the toggle needs no restart). Turkish + English, roughly
  2 seconds per page, and with the language data on disk nothing leaves the
  machine. Rows read by OCR are badged so they get a second look.
- The assignment picker searches the roster by name or department, Turkish-aware
  — typing "ayse" finds "Ayşe" — instead of a plain dropdown of every employee.

### Fixed
- **Turkish uppercase was invisible to every form heuristic.** JavaScript's `/i`
  flag does not relate `İ` (U+0130) to `i`, so a form titled "ZİMMET TESLİM
  TUTANAĞI" — the normal casing — matched nothing: multi-form PDFs collapsed into
  one document and "TESLİM ALAN:" never yielded a name. All marker and label
  matching now runs on Turkish-folded text.
- **Multi-page forms were shredded.** The form marker was matched anywhere on the
  page, so body copy ("…işbu zimmet tutanağı…") started a new form on every page
  and split one 3-page form into three. Only a short heading near the top of a
  page starts a form now.
- A match no longer reports high confidence when the runner-up is itself an
  excellent match (two employees with near-identical names) — that case asks.
- The Zimmet Import nav entry checked only one of the two permissions its API
  requires, so a group holding just `handover_document:upload` saw a menu item
  the server then refused.

## [1.3.36] — 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- A request with a malformed JSON body now returns **400 “Invalid JSON body”**
  instead of a generic 500 (it’s a client mistake, not a server crash).

## [1.3.35] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Suggested salvage value.** When entering the purchase cost on a new or
  edited asset, the salvage field is pre-filled with a suggestion derived from
  the cost and the category’s EOL window — longer-life gear keeps more residual
  value (≤24 mo 5%, ≤48 mo 10%, ≤72 mo 15%, >72 mo 20%). A hint shows the
  reasoning; it only auto-fills until you type your own and stays fully editable.

## [1.3.34] — 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- **Reports are fully localized.** Report tables were half-translated — only a
  handful of column names had translations and every summary line was hardcoded
  English, so screens like the depreciation / book-value report mixed Turkish
  headers with English ones (PURCHASE COST, SALVAGE, BOOK VALUE…) and an English
  summary. All report column headers and summaries now go through i18n.

## [1.3.33] — 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- **Sell permission now stands alone.** The sale button appeared (and the server
  allowed selling) for a permission group that had `asset:manage` but not
  `asset:sell`, because both checks fell back to manage. Selling is a sensitive
  action that must not come from manage (like export / view_confidential): the
  button and the Sold transition now require `asset:sell` specifically. Owner and
  role-based Admin/Helpdesk still get it via fallback.

### Docs
- README lists all six roles (adds HR and Portal) and the custom permission
  matrix; corrects the document upload cap to 8 MB.

## [1.3.32] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Dedicated “sell” permission.** Marking an asset Sold is now its own
  `asset:sell` action in the permission matrix instead of riding on
  asset:update — custom permission groups must be granted it explicitly
  (role-based Admin/Helpdesk and `manage` keep it). The sale dialog now
  **requires the approving manager’s name** and offers a **currency selector**
  (defaults to the app currency) next to the price.

### Fixed
- **Deleting a department with teams** no longer fails: when you pick a target
  to move employees to, the department’s teams move across as well (any name
  clash is renamed), so the department can actually be removed.
- **Product Catalog** screen is now fully localized (headers, buttons, hints,
  toasts) instead of hardcoded English.
- The **“clear default location”** control is a tidy, aligned round icon button.

## [1.3.31] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Customizable table columns.** A gear button on every listing table
  (Hardware, Employees, Licenses, Consumables, Mobile Lines, Network,
  Contracts, Maintenance) opens a small panel to show/hide columns and
  drag to reorder them. The layout is remembered per browser until reset,
  and CSV exports follow the visible columns (Network keeps its full export).

### Fixed
- Column panel header showed the wrong label ("Ünvan") — now "Görünecek sütunlar".
- On narrow layouts the column panel was drawn under the table's sticky action
  column; it now renders above the table.

## [1.3.30] — 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **Mobile keyboard** no longer drops while searching Employees, Network and
  the Providers contract list (search updates results in place).
- **Editing a phone** no longer reports its own IMEI as a duplicate.
- **CSV export** keeps Turkish (and other non-ASCII) characters intact.
- A wrong password / MFA code no longer logs you out to the sign-in screen.
- HR onboarding/offboarding cancel uses a styled dialog; the onboarding due
  modal can cancel a scheduled onboarding and refreshes the list on complete.

### Added
- **Sell** action on the device detail (buyer / price / date), so a device can
  be sold without going through offboarding.
- **Consumables** can be edited and deleted, not just stock-adjusted.
- Mobile lines reject a duplicate SIM serial; the import template ships IMEI
  columns.
- License cancel warns (and can revoke seats) when the license is still held;
  deleting a department offers to move its employees first; the default location
  can be cleared; the catalog brand field lists existing brands per category.
- An **HR account placed in a permission group** is broadened by that group
  (e.g. + Employees) while keeping its HR screens.

### Security
- Assets can no longer be created directly with `Assigned`/`In Repair` status.
- `/dashboard/stats` scopes recent-handover names and fleet financials to the
  caller's permissions instead of `dashboard:read` alone.

## [1.3.29] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **CSV/Excel import** no longer errors on rows without an IMEI, and now flags
  duplicate/existing IMEIs per row instead of aborting the whole import.
- **License key** is no longer overwritten with its masked form when a
  non-privileged user edits a license.
- Per-user `custom_constraints` are now actually applied (list and detail).
- Handover acknowledgement page labels mobile lines correctly.

### Changed
- Text responses are gzip-compressed and static assets are cache-headed
  (~70% smaller first load); one duplicate per-request user lookup removed;
  large inventory imports batched into set-based inserts.

### Security
- Assets can no longer be created directly with `Assigned`/`In Repair` status,
  which bypassed the handover and maintenance flows.

## [1.3.28] — 2026-08-06

### Added
- **Secondary IMEI (IMEI 2)** on Phone/Tablet forms for dual-SIM devices.
  Search, detail, CSV, import, and stock-count scan cover both IMEIs; values
  must be unique across primary/secondary and across assets.

## [1.3.27] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **Startup migration for IMEI.** Refreshing `ai.assets` after adding `imei`
  failed on existing databases (`cannot change name of view column "brand" to
  "imei"`). The migration now drops and recreates the view (and re-grants
  `itacm_ai_ro`).

## [1.3.26] — 2026-08-06

### Added
- **Primary IMEI on phones and tablets.** Hardware add/edit shows an IMEI field
  for Phone/Tablet (first / primary IMEI). Stored as a first-class column with
  uniqueness when set; included in hardware search, detail view, CSV export,
  stock-count scan/match, and optional CSV import.

### Fixed
- **Owner recovery after `reset-password --clear-mfa`.** Changing the temporary
  password was blocked with "Owners must enable MFA before using the app"
  because `/api/auth/password` was not allowlisted while MFA was cleared.
  Password change now completes first; MFA re-enrolment follows.

## [1.3.25] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **"My zimmet" (self-service) table headers now translate.** The Devices,
  Software and Mobile-lines table headers on the employee self-service page were
  passed to `t()` as English literals (`t('Category')`…), so — since those keys
  do not exist — they showed English in every language. Moved them to real
  12-language keys. (Found by an app-wide i18n coverage sweep.)
- **AI assistant code blocks no longer double-escape.** `renderMarkdown` escaped
  fenced-code content twice (so `<` showed as `&lt;`); it now uses private-use
  placeholders to escape exactly once, and the old brittle un-escaping of
  `&lt;code…&gt;` markers is gone (a small hardening too).

### Added
- **Guard test** asserting every `ai.*` view is mapped in
  `sqlGuard.VIEW_PERMISSIONS`, so a future view can't become readable through
  `advanced_query` with only `ai:use` (bypassing per-resource RBAC).

### Security
- Completed a deep security/pentest pass (AI SQL guard + curated views, SSRF with
  DNS pinning, JWT/session handling, SQL injection, command injection, uploads,
  IDOR, XSS). No exploitable High/Medium findings; see the audit notes.

## [1.3.24] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **Failed hardware search no longer leaves the list stuck on skeleton rows.**
  When the in-place search refetch (added in 1.3.23) errored — e.g. a dropped
  connection — it returned early and left the ghost rows painted. It now repaints
  the current rows before showing the error, so the list stays usable. (Found in a
  security/bug audit.)

## [1.3.23] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **Hardware search keeps the keyboard open on mobile.** Each keystroke used to
  re-render the whole hardware view, which rebuilt the search box and — on phones —
  closed the on-screen keyboard (a programmatic re-focus can't reopen it), so you
  could barely type. Search now refetches and repaints **only the results region**,
  leaving the search box mounted: the keyboard stays up, focus is kept and no
  character is dropped. Filters/sort/pagination still do a full navigation as before.

### Added
- **Copy button next to the serial number** in the asset detail. A small button
  beside "Serial No" copies the value to the clipboard (with a checkmark + toast).

## [1.3.22] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **Hardware list no longer gets stuck on empty/ghost rows after a return, repair
  or scrap.** After such an action the list refreshes with the same filters, so
  the URL hash is unchanged and the browser fires no `hashchange` — the freshly
  painted skeleton was then never replaced and the table looked permanently empty.
  The refresh now re-runs the view explicitly when the hash does not change, so the
  skeleton is always replaced with fresh data (and the action's result actually
  shows without a manual reload).

## [1.3.21] — 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Skeleton on the first paint of the hardware list too.** 1.3.19 ghosted the
  rows only on in-view search/filter refetches, which flash by when the API is
  fast. Opening the hardware page (or arriving from another view) now shows a full
  skeleton — header, metric cards, toolbar and ghost rows — while the first load
  is in flight, so the loading state is actually visible. In-view search still
  ghosts just the rows and keeps the search box mounted.

## [1.3.20] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **Front-end updates now reach browsers on a normal refresh — no hard-refresh
  needed.** The JS/CSS in `index.html` are cache-busted with manual `?v=` query
  strings that had not been bumped for the files changed in 1.3.14–1.3.19, so a
  cached browser kept running the old scripts after `git pull` (this is why the
  search fix, the scanner gate and the localisations appeared not to take). Bumped
  the `?v=` on every changed asset (app.css, i18n.js, ui.js, mobile-shell.js and
  the assets/onboarding/hr/dashboard/catalog/users views) so the browser fetches
  the new versions automatically.

## [1.3.19] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **Search no longer drops the last character you type.** Typing e.g. `1337` in
  the hardware search could lose the final digit: the debounced search re-renders
  the list, and any keystroke entered while the results were being fetched landed
  in an input that was about to be replaced. The debounced search now mirrors the
  live value and restores it (and re-applies it) after the re-render, so fast
  typing survives. This applies to every debounced search box in the app.

### Added
- **Skeleton loading for the hardware list.** When a search, filter, sort or page
  change refetches, the list now shows shimmering ghost rows instead of feeling
  like a full-page refresh.

## [1.3.18] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Mobile modal action bar no longer covers the screen.** On phones the modal
  footer stacked every action button full-width in a single column, so an
  action-heavy dialog — e.g. the asset detail with Close / QR / Label / Edit /
  Duplicate / Repair / Handover — produced a ~7-row footer that filled the lower
  half of the screen and pushed the body content behind it. The footer is now a
  2-column grid (a lone trailing button spans the full width), roughly halving its
  height so the scrollable body keeps its room.

## [1.3.17] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Barcode/QR scanner: closed the last un-gated entry point.** v1.3.14 hid the
  scanner from users without inventory access on the desktop topbar and the mobile
  center FAB, but the **"Scan asset" item in the mobile "More" sheet** was still
  shown to everyone. It is now gated on the same `asset:read` permission, so Portal
  (self-service), HR and other restricted users no longer see any way to open the
  camera scanner.

## [1.3.16] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Localized the Onboarding wizard, reports, status badges and the catalog-model
  dialog.** Several surfaces still showed English inside a non-English UI:
  - Onboarding wizard field labels (Full name / Email / Department / Title /
    Notes), the stock filter, "no stock / no free lines" empty states, the
    review step (Employee / Reserved assets / Reserved lines) and the
    Cancel / Back / Next buttons.
  - Asset **status badges** (In Stock / Assigned / In Repair / Reserved / Scrap /
    Sold, plus Active / Inactive) now translate everywhere via a single display
    helper — the canonical English value is unchanged, so filters and exports
    keep working. The **EOL / EOL soon** lifecycle pills are localized too.
  - **Report** chrome: Print / Export CSV buttons, the "first 100 of N rows"
    preview note, the row-count footer, common column headers and the
    "N assigned assets across M employees" summary. CSV exports keep English
    headers for stable downstream parsing.
  - The **Add catalog model** dialog (title, field labels, placeholder, submit
    button and success toast).

### Changed
- **HR onboarding email is now optional for HR — IT fills it in.** HR often does
  not know a new hire's address when filing the ticket. The HR onboarding form no
  longer requires an email; when IT acknowledges the request on the dashboard, it
  prompts for a valid email (only when the ticket has none) and saves it onto the
  request before provisioning the employee. A new migration
  (`046_hr_request_optional_email.sql`) rebuilds the pending-onboard dedup index so
  it only applies to tickets that actually carry an email.

## [1.3.15] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Localized the New IT User and Transfer Ownership dialogs.** Their field labels,
  hints and buttons were hardcoded in English regardless of the selected UI
  language; they now use the 12-language i18n. The New IT User dialog also notes
  that if the person already has web (self-service) access it must be removed first
  (one login per person).

## [1.3.14] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Barcode/QR scanner no longer offered to users without inventory access.** The
  mobile center scan FAB (and the desktop topbar scan button) showed for Portal
  self-service and HR accounts even though they can't read assets — the scan looks
  an asset up by its tag, so it was useless (and would prompt for the camera) for
  them. Both are now gated on `asset:read`; the mobile nav keeps its layout with an
  empty center when the scanner is hidden.

## [1.3.13] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **`npm run update` — one-command update.** Backs up the database, `git pull`s,
  and rebuilds with the compose profile your `.env` implies — plain
  (`docker compose up`), own domain (`--profile tls`), or Cloudflare
  (`--profile cloudflare`, detected from `APP_DOMAIN` + `certs/origin.pem`) — so
  you never have to remember which `--profile` / `--build` flag to pass. Then it
  prints the version now running. `npm run update -- --dry-run` previews the
  detected command without changing anything. `.env` and `certs/` are untouched.

## [1.3.12] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Running version shown in the sidebar.** A small, muted label (e.g. `v1.3.12`)
  now sits at the bottom of the left sidebar so the current version is visible at
  a glance (previously only under Help → About). It reads what the backend reports
  at `/api/config`, so after an update it reflects the running build — a quick way
  to confirm a rebuild actually took effect.

## [1.3.11] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Manual "Check now" button for software updates** (Integrations → Software
  updates, Owner). The automatic check runs at most once a day; this button forces
  an immediate check against GitHub and shows the result inline — "you're on the
  latest version (vX)", "update available: vX", or "couldn't reach the update
  server". It runs regardless of the auto-check toggle (clicking is explicit
  consent). New `POST /api/integrations/update-check` (integration:manage); the
  check awaits the result and ignores the daily throttle.

## [1.3.10] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **`npm run setup` now configures HTTPS interactively.** The new-install wizard
  asks how the app will be reached — local HTTP, own domain (auto HTTPS via
  Caddy), or behind Cloudflare — and writes the matching `.env` (`APP_DOMAIN`,
  `APP_URL`, `TRUST_PROXY`, host-local `API_PORT`) plus the exact
  `docker compose --profile …` start command. For the Cloudflare path it walks
  you through creating an Origin Certificate and lets you **paste the certificate
  and key straight in**, writing `certs/origin.pem` / `certs/origin.key` (key
  `chmod 600`) for you — no manual file editing. It then prints the steps only you
  can do (DNS record, Cloudflare SSL mode, firewall).

## [1.3.9] — 2026-08-03

### Changed
- **AI assistant is now a matrix-controlled permission (`ai:use`).** Previously
  every non-Portal/HR user could open the assistant; it now requires the new
  `ai:use` permission, so access is granted per group in the IAM matrix. Owner
  and Admin get it by default (migration 045 + role fallback); Helpdesk, Viewer
  and custom groups must be granted it explicitly. `/api/ai/status`, `/query` and
  `/exports/:id` enforce it, so the launcher simply doesn't appear for users who
  lack it. The assistant's tools still apply each user's own per-resource RBAC on
  top of this.

## [1.3.8] — 2026-08-03

### Documentation
- **Cloudflare HTTPS guide completed + update pitfall fixed.** The "Behind
  Cloudflare" section now includes the DNS A-record and firewall (`443`) steps,
  so it's a full from-scratch walkthrough. The Updating section now warns that if
  you started with an HTTPS profile (`--profile tls` / `--profile cloudflare`)
  you must pass the **same flag** when updating — otherwise the reverse-proxy
  container isn't recreated and HTTPS goes down. Docs only.

## [1.3.7] — 2026-08-03

### Documentation
- **README brought up to date with the AI assistant** (added in 1.3.0 but not
  documented): a new Feature-highlights entry, a Modules-table row, `/api/ai/*`
  in the API reference, and `AI_*` / `APP_URL` / `APP_DOMAIN` in the
  configuration reference. No code changes.

## [1.3.6] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Turnkey HTTPS behind Cloudflare (Origin Certificate).** New
  `docker compose --profile cloudflare up -d` serves the app on 443 with a
  Cloudflare Origin Certificate instead of Let's Encrypt — which cannot be issued
  behind Cloudflare's orange-cloud proxy. Drop the cert/key from Cloudflare
  (SSL/TLS → Origin Server) into `certs/`, set `APP_DOMAIN`, keep the api
  host-local, and switch Cloudflare to Full (strict) for end-to-end TLS. New
  `Caddyfile.cloudflare` and `caddy-cf` service; `certs/` keys are git-ignored
  (with a README); README and `.env.example` now document both HTTPS paths (`tls`
  for direct, `cloudflare` for proxied). Off by default; the standard stack is
  unchanged.

## [1.3.5] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Onboarding tour no longer shows developer setup notes.** The "See the product
  in action" step listed "drop your own video at /media/how-it-works.mp4" and
  "set ONBOARDING_VIDEO_URL" — internal setup instructions that don't belong in an
  end-user wizard. Replaced with a single plain-language line (EN + TR); the step
  still falls back to the built-in animated demo reel when no video is configured.

## [1.3.4] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Loading states.** A first-load **boot splash** (centered spinner + product
  name) now covers the brief gap before the app picks onboarding / login /
  dashboard — no more blank flash on startup, with a failsafe so it can never
  stick. Page navigation shows a proper **spinner** in the content area instead
  of plain "Loading…" text, matching the 404 / 403 / error screens.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **One-command automatic HTTPS (Caddy `tls` compose profile).** `docker compose
  --profile tls up -d` runs a bundled Caddy reverse proxy that fetches and renews
  a Let's Encrypt certificate for `APP_DOMAIN` on its own — HTTP→HTTPS redirect
  included, no certbot / nginx / manual certificates. Off by default, so the
  standard stack is unchanged. New `Caddyfile`; documented in the README and
  `.env.example` (`APP_DOMAIN`, plus the `TRUST_PROXY=1` / `APP_URL` pairing).

## [1.3.2] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **"App URL" setting (Integrations → Notifications).** The public address this
  instance is reached at, used for links in outbound email (alert digest,
  handover, owner-transfer). Previously those links came only from the
  undocumented `APP_URL` / `PUBLIC_URL` env var and defaulted to
  `http://localhost:8000`, so a deployed instance mailed broken localhost links.
  It's now set in-app (no `.env` editing), validated and normalized (http/https,
  trailing slash stripped), localized across 12 languages. The env var remains a
  fallback and is documented in `.env.example`.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **AI assistant launcher advertised the wrong shortcut.** The floating launcher
  showed `⌘K`, but `⌘K` is bound to global search, so it never opened the
  assistant (the working shortcut is `⌘J`). Corrected the badge and tooltip to
  `⌘J` across all 12 locales; clicking the launcher continues to work.
- **Department-scoped employee directory was inaccessible.** A user whose
  `employee:read` grant carried a department constraint got a 403 on the whole
  directory — the list gate evaluated the constraint against an empty context and
  failed closed, before the row-scoping filter could run. List reads are now
  gated on the capability (`requireCapability`) and the department scope is
  enforced on the rows, so such users see exactly their department(s). Fails
  safe: no grant → still 403; cross-department detail reads remain blocked.

### Security
- **body-parser bumped to 1.20.6** (from 1.20.5) to clear a low-severity DoS
  advisory (GHSA-v422-hmwv-36x6). `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities. Follows a deep
  security review (auth/JWT, IAM constraints, injection, SSRF, path-traversal,
  CSV formula injection, XSS/CSP) that surfaced no exploitable High/Critical/
  Medium issues.

### Added
- **Designed 404 / 403 / error screens.** Unknown routes now show a localized
  404 page (previously a silent redirect to the dashboard); routes the user
  cannot open show a 403 "access denied" page; a view that fails to load shows an
  error screen with Retry / Home actions. All render in the content area with the
  navigation intact, in the selected language (12 locales).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-08-02

### Added
- **AI assistant (natural-language queries).** A provider-agnostic chat
  assistant answers questions about the inventory in the selected UI language.
  Works with a local Ollama model or a cloud API (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic,
  Groq, Mistral, Together, OpenRouter, or a custom endpoint), with streaming
  answers, result tables, CSV export, auto charts, and a collapsible "show SQL"
  view. **Disabled by default** — an admin enables it under Integrations → AI.
- **Guarded advanced queries.** For analytical questions the assistant can run a
  read-only `advanced_query` against a curated `ai.*` view schema — never the
  base tables. Executed under a low-privilege NOLOGIN role via `SET LOCAL ROLE`
  in a read-only, statement-timed transaction (always rolled back), behind an
  app-side single-SELECT validator.

### Security
- **Per-resource RBAC on `advanced_query`.** Every `ai.*` view maps to an app
  permission; the caller must hold read on each view a query touches, so the
  assistant cannot surface data (contracts, costs, lines…) a role is denied
  elsewhere. Matching is fail-safe (can only withhold, never grant).
- **`ai.contracts` hardened with `security_barrier`** (migration 044) to block
  leaky-qual oracles across the Confidential-row filter.
- **Per-user rate limit on `/api/ai/query`** (default 20/min, `AI_QUERY_RATE_MAX`
  to override) to contain provider cost and abuse.
- **SSRF-safe outbound** to AI endpoints (DNS-pinned; private/reserved/metadata
  addresses blocked) and **encrypted-at-rest, masked** provider API keys.

### Migrations
- `042_ai_settings.sql`, `043_ai_query_schema.sql`, `044_ai_contracts_security_barrier.sql`
  run automatically on start.

### Fixed
- **Handover screen fully localized.** The document-generation panel and other
  handover UI strings (In Stock Only, Single/Separate document, Confirm & Print,
  basket labels, condition-note fields, acknowledgement modal, etc.) were
  hardcoded in English; they now follow the selected language across 12 locales.

## [1.2.24] — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Server-side account recovery: `npm run reset-password`.** Resets an Owner/IT
  user password (forces a change on next login, revokes sessions) and, with
  `--clear-mfa`, removes their TOTP so a locked-out Owner who lost their
  authenticator can regain access. Runs only on the box/container (no network
  endpoint), so it adds no attack surface. Docs: README recovery section.

## [1.2.23] — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Startup guard: refuse to boot on a missing/weak `JWT_SECRET`** (< 32 chars).
  A short signing key makes session tokens forgeable; the server now exits with
  clear guidance (`openssl rand -hex 32`) instead of running insecurely. Existing
  installs generated by `npm run setup` (64-char key) are unaffected.

## [1.2.22] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: `src/utils/setupAccess.js` was corrupted** with non-code text
  prepended by an external edit tool, which committed into 1.2.21 and crash-
  looped the API (`Unexpected identifier`). Restored the file and rebuilt it.

### Changed
- **Rate-limit / brute-force IP now resolves the real client behind a trusted
  proxy.** When `TRUST_PROXY` is set (e.g. behind Cloudflare + nginx/Traefik),
  `rateLimitIp` uses `CF-Connecting-IP` (then `req.ip`) so limits are per-visitor
  instead of bucketing every user under the proxy IP. With no proxy declared it
  still uses the unspoofable TCP peer, so headers cannot be forged to dodge limits.

## [1.2.21] — 2026-07-30

### Changed
- **Removed the fleet-value strip from the dashboard** (Fleet Purchase Value /
  Current Book Value / Depreciated). Per-asset book value on the asset detail and
  the Asset Depreciation / Book Value report are unchanged.

## [1.2.20] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Portal (self-service) users appeared in the IT Users operators list and the
  role dropdown mis-displayed them as 'Owner'.** Granting an employee web access
  creates a `Portal` login (confined to `/api/me`); it is not an IT operator.
  `listUsers()` now excludes `Portal` accounts, so they no longer surface in the
  operators table. Defensive frontend guard added: a user whose role is not in
  the dropdown options now shows that role (disabled) instead of defaulting the
  browser to the first option ('Owner').

## [1.2.19] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **IT Users / IAM screens localized in all 12 languages.** The IT Users list
  (subtitle, buttons, permission-group cards incl. built-in descriptions, the
  operators table + status/role columns) and the IAM permissions-matrix modal
  chrome (warnings, matrix header, resource/actions columns, buttons) now go
  through the i18n layer. The technical permission tokens (read/create/asset/…)
  stay as-is since they mirror the API identifiers.

## [1.2.18] — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Custom report builder: filter Hardware Assets by assignment + employee.** A
  new **Assignment** filter (All / Assigned / Unassigned) and a multi-select
  **Assigned to (employees)** filter let you build a custom report scoped to one
  or more specific holders.

### Changed
- **Custom report builder localized in all 12 languages** — data-source cards,
  step labels, filter labels / options, column chips, Generate/preview text and
  the generated custom-report title/columns now go through the i18n layer.

## [1.2.17] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Help & tips modal localized in all 12 languages.** UI-tips toggle, page-tip
  callout, guided-tour / replay-intro buttons, keyboard shortcuts, role
  descriptions and the About text now go through the i18n layer.

## [1.2.16] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Reports module localized in all 12 languages.** The page subtitle, KPI stat
  tiles, range selector, Ready/Build-your-own tabs, search, group filter pills,
  and all 20 preset report titles + descriptions + the Open action now go
  through the i18n layer.

## [1.2.15] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Maintenance & Repair and Stock Count localized in all 12 languages.** Wired
  the maintenance list (filters, columns, In-Repair pill, Notes/Close), the
  close-repair dialog, the repair notes & documents modal, and the stock-count
  session table (columns, Open/Closed pills, Continue/Result) through t().

## [1.2.14] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Hardware list header and Product Catalog EOL tables localized in all 12
  languages.** The hardware page subtitle + "managed separately" note and the
  per-model / per-category lifecycle (EOL) tables (Brand/Model/Lifecycle columns,
  "mo" unit, Delete) now go through t().

## [1.2.13] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Provider / contract forms and the license "Assigned" modal localized in all
  12 languages.** Wired the provider and contract form fields (website, company
  / support contact fields, billing, dates, cost, owner, etc.) and the license
  holders modal (Users/Devices headers, Revoke/Close, empty state) through t().
  Also fixed the EN/TR-only `hr.status` key that was poisoning the reverse-index
  lookup for the word "Status" in other languages.

## [1.2.12] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Consumables and Mobile Lines localized in all 12 languages.** Wired their
  list views (columns, status pills, empty states, action buttons), the
  new/adjust consumable dialogs and the new/edit mobile-line form (labels,
  placeholders, status options) + toasts through the i18n layer.

## [1.2.11] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Hardware (asset) detail modal localized in all 12 languages.** Its overview/
  specs/infrastructure labels, lifecycle bar, licenses/note/custom-field/history/
  repair sections, footer actions and the return dialog were hardcoded English
  and now go through the i18n layer (new `hw.d.*` keys, all 12 languages).

## [1.2.10] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Employees module localized in all 12 languages.** Wired the directory list
  (header, search, columns, filter chips, empty states, action titles), the
  person-detail modal (assigned assets/software/lines/contracts, handover
  receipts, documents tab) and the portal-credentials dialog through the i18n
  layer, filling DE, FR, ES, IT, PT, NL, PL, RU, AR, JA.

## [1.2.9] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Asset form and License module now ship real translations for all 12
  languages** (previously EN/TR only). Every `asset.f.*` and `lic.*` key is
  filled for DE, FR, ES, IT, PT, NL, PL, RU, AR, JA. Continues the 12-language
  coverage started with the dashboard; RU/AR/JA are machine-assisted.

## [1.2.8] — 2026-07-29

### Changed
- **Dashboard now ships real translations for all 12 languages** (not just EN/TR
  with English fallback). Every `dash.*` string is filled for DE, FR, ES, IT, PT,
  NL, PL, RU, AR, JA. Start of expanding the whole UI to genuine 12-language
  coverage; RU/AR/JA are machine-assisted and benefit from a native review.

## [1.2.7] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Dashboard was largely in English regardless of language.** Localized the
  whole dashboard: KPI cards, fleet-value strip, scheduled-onboarding and HR
  panels, recent-handover and EOL tables, the "Attention Required" cards, asset
  distribution and license-expiry panels, and the location breakdown popup
  (new `dash.*` keys with Turkish; other languages fall back to English).

## [1.2.6] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **License list view + renew/cancel/assign dialogs were still English.**
  Continued the localization pass: page header, table headings, status pills,
  row hints, action-button titles, empty state, and the renew/cancel/assign
  dialog fields / toasts now use the i18n layer (Turkish; others fall back to
  English). Part of the ongoing full-app localization.

## [1.2.5] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **License add/edit form was always in English.** Wired its labels, section
  headings, hints, placeholders, dropdown options, buttons and the renew/cancel/
  assign dialog titles through the i18n layer (new `lic.f.*` keys with Turkish;
  other languages fall back to English). Continues the form-i18n pass started
  with the asset form in 1.2.4.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Add/Edit asset form was always in English**, ignoring the selected UI
  language. Its labels, section headings, hints, placeholders and buttons were
  hardcoded. They now go through the i18n layer (~50 new `asset.f.*` keys, with
  Turkish translations; other languages fall back to English as usual). Purely
  technical labels (MAC, OS, CPU/RAM/STORAGE) are intentionally left untranslated.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Report print stopped after one page.** Printing a preset report (e.g. Full
  Inventory, 300+ rows) reused the one-page handover-receipt print styles, which
  clamp the sheet to a single A4 page (`max-height` + `overflow: hidden`), so
  every row past the first page was clipped. Report prints now carry a
  `receipt-report` modifier that lets the table flow across as many pages as
  needed, repeats the column header on each page, and avoids splitting a row.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Update popups showed a raw `<span class="ms">…</span>` tag in the title.**
  `openModal` escapes its title (by design), but the "Update available" and
  "System updated" dialogs embedded an icon as HTML in the title string, so the
  markup rendered as literal text. `openModal` now takes an optional `icon`
  parameter and both dialogs pass a plain-text title — the rocket / update icon
  renders correctly again.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **Dashboard & asset create/update returned "Internal server error" on 1.2.0.**
  The depreciation feature referenced an `assets.cost` column that was never
  created — the `NUMERIC cost` column lives on `maintenance_logs`, not `assets`.
  Added migration `041_asset_cost.sql` (and the matching `schema.sql` column) so
  the dashboard EOL/fleet-value query and asset writes work. Existing 1.2.0
  installs pick up the column automatically on next start.
- **Guided sidebar tour (coach-marks) was cut off at the bottom.** Taller steps
  now measure their real height and clamp their position so the whole card —
  including the Skip / Next buttons — always stays on-screen.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Straight-line asset depreciation / book value.** Every asset now carries a
  **purchase cost** and an optional **salvage value**; the current **book value**
  is computed straight-line over the *same* lifecycle window the EOL engine
  already resolves (per-asset → catalog model → category default). Shown on the
  asset detail ("Book value · N% depreciated") and rolled up on the dashboard as
  **Fleet Purchase Value / Current Book Value / Depreciated** (active inventory),
  and exportable as a new **Asset Depreciation / Book Value** preset report
  (Reports → Hardware) with per-asset cost, salvage, book value and totals.
  - The lifecycle-resolution rule was extracted into a pure, unit-tested
    `src/utils/depreciation.js` shared by the asset service and the dashboard EOL
    engine, so EOL dates and book values can never drift apart.
  - Schema: one nullable `assets.salvage_value` column (migration
    `040_asset_salvage_value.sql`); the existing `assets.cost` column is now
    editable from the asset form. A category with a 0 lifecycle is excluded from
    depreciation (keeps full value), matching its EOL behaviour.
- **Scheduled automatic alert digests.** The alert digest (expired/expiring
  licenses, low stock, EOL overdue, onboarding due) can now be sent
  automatically on a **daily** or **weekly** cadence, configured under
  **Integrations → SMTP & alert digest** (Auto-send: Off / Daily / Weekly, with
  a time-of-day and — for weekly — a weekday, in server local time). Previously
  the digest only fired when an admin clicked **Run digest now**.
  - A lightweight in-process scheduler (1-minute tick, no new dependency) runs
    `runScheduledDigest()`; all "is it due / already ran today" logic lives in
    the pure, unit-tested `src/utils/digestSchedule.js`.
  - The cadence is stored inside the existing `app_settings.notify_json`
    (`schedule`, `hour`, `weekday`, plus a server-managed `lastRunDate` guard) —
    **no schema migration required**. Default is `off`, so existing instances
    are unchanged until an Owner/Admin opts in.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Owner toggle for the upstream update check** under **Integrations →
  Software updates**. The preference is persisted in `app_settings.update_check`
  (nullable — `NULL` inherits the `UPDATE_CHECK` env default, `TRUE`/`FALSE` is
  an explicit Owner choice), so the check can be turned on/off from the UI
  without editing `.env`.

### Changed
- `/api/config` now reflects the effective (DB-or-env) update-check state when
  computing `updateAvailable`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-26

### Added
- **In-app update notice.** The running app version is now surfaced through
  `/api/config` and `/api/health`. When the server starts on a newer version
  than the browser last acknowledged, the **Owner** gets a one-time popup on
  their next login/reload announcing the new version, with a link to the
  release notes. Fully self-hosted — no outbound calls, no CSP change. Each
  browser stores the last-seen version in `localStorage` (`itacm_seen_version`)
  and never fires on a fresh install or a rollback.
- App version is shown in **Help → About**.
- **Opt-in upstream update check** (`UPDATE_CHECK=1`). When on, the server asks
  the GitHub Releases API — at most once a day — whether a release newer than the
  running version exists, and shows the Owner an "update available" popup with a
  link to the release. Off by default; offline / air-gapped installs never reach
  out. Configurable via `UPDATE_CHECK_REPO` and `UPDATE_CHECK_TOKEN`
  (`GITHUB_TOKEN` also accepted). _(Made toggleable from the UI in 1.1.1.)_
- `CHANGELOG.md` and a documented update path (see README "Updating").

### Changed
- `/api/health` and `/api/config` responses now include a `version` field;
  `/api/config` also carries `updateAvailable` when the upstream check is on.
