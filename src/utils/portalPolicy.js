 * Portal policy helpers — which paths a self-service employee login may reach.

 * in the app is closed to Portal accounts until it is named here, so forgetting
 * to think about them fails safe.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free (like mfaPolicy / passwordPolicy) so the confinement
 * rules can be unit-tested without a database — see tests/portal-confinement.
